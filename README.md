# Predicting Employee Attrition Using Behavioural Data

A machine learning system that identifies employees at risk of leaving by analyzing behavioural patterns. Built with a full data science pipeline - from synthetic data generation to an interactive Flask web application with SHAP-based interpretability.

## Overview

Employee attrition disrupts business stability and drives up operational costs. This project uses machine learning on synthetic behavioural employee data to predict attrition risk and provide interpretable, actionable insights for HR teams.

This project is also published as a public dataset on Kaggle:

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/personacarved/employee-attrition-dataset

The dataset includes the synthetic employee behavioural data used in this project, enabling others to explore, benchmark, and build upon the model.This publication demonstrates the end-to-end ownership of the project - from data generation and validation to public release and reproducible machine learning experimentation.

**Key Features:**
- Synthetic dataset generation for privacy-safe modeling
- 8 ML models trained and compared head-to-head
- SHAP and Permutation Importance for model explainability
- Flask web app supporting both single-entry and bulk CSV predictions
- Full evaluation suite: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC, PR curves
